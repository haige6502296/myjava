        <!--But, if you change the name of bean, it will not inject the dependency.
        Let's see the code where we are changing the name of the bean from b to b1.In this case,
        it works fine because you have created an instance of B type. It doesn't matter that you
         have different bean name than reference name.
        But, if you have multiple bean of one type, it will not work and throw exception.
        Let's see the code where are many bean of type B
        <bean id="b1" class="org.sssit.B"></bean>
        <bean id="b2" class="org.sssit.B"></bean>
        <bean id="a" class="org.sssit.A" autowire="byName"></bean>
        In such case, it will throw exception.
